# Development of a ROS Library in C++ for Dynamixel Motors

## Description
This Bachelor's Thesis project aims to develop a high-level library for Dynamixel motors, commonly used in various robotic applications. The library will be based on the [Dynamixel SDK](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_sdk/overview/) (source development kit), which is Open Source and includes basic functions such as writing to and reading from the motor registers. This project is freely available to all members of the scientific community with the goal of facilitating motor control and improving efficiency.
